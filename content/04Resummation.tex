\chapter{Resummation}
\section{Introduction}
In this chapter we present a detailed discussion of \emph{resummation}, with particular emphasis on the semi-numerical approaches first mentioned in Sec.~\ref{sec:high-energy-picture}, namely the \textsc{CAESAR}  (\emph{Computer Automated Expert Semi-Analytical Resummer})~\cite{Banfi:2004yd} and \textsc{ARES} (\emph{Automated Resummation for Event Shapes}) ~\cite{Banfi:2014sua} formalisms. These frameworks provide systematic methods for resumming logarithmically enhanced contributions that appear in perturbative QCD calculations for a broad class of IRC safe observables known as \emph{event-shape observables} (event shapes). As discussed in Sec.~\ref{sec:IRC} as well as Sec.~\ref{sec:high-energy-picture}, the need for resummation arises when fixed-order perturbative predictions become unreliable due to the presence of large logarithms which occur when the observable becomes small. Such logarithms can spoil the convergence of the perturbative expansion and must be resummed to all orders in the strong coupling to obtain meaningful theoretical predictions. In order to see this explicitly, we wish to illustrate this by looking at the fixed-order calculation of a specific observable, thereby motivating the need for resummation. We then introduce the \textsc{CAESAR} framework, which enables the automated resummation of a general event-shape observable to next-to-leading logarithmic (NLL) accuracy. \textsc{CAESAR} has been successfully applied to both $e^+e^-$ and hadronic collision processes~\cite{Banfi:2004yd, Banfi:2004nk} \question{check these are the correct references}. Building upon this, we describe the \textsc{ARES} formalism, which extends the \textsc{CAESAR} approach to achieve next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic (NNLL) precision. To date, \textsc{ARES} has been developed and applied to $e^+e^-$ collisions~\cite{Banfi:2014sua, Banfi:2018mcq, Arpino:2019ozn} \question{check these are the correct references}. Work done in Chapter~5 consists of original research where the \textsc{ARES} formalism is applied to hadronic collisions for the \emph{very first time}. In this chapter, we will discuss and outline how this extension is applied and thus show how the treatment of initial-state radiation within \textsc{ARES} is applied.


\section{Motivation}
In this section, we focus on a specific observable that has been extensively studied in the literature, known as \emph{thrust}~\cite{Farhi:1977sg, Brandt:1964sa}. Thrust is an example of an IRC safe observable, see Sec.~\ref{sec:IRC}, specifically belonging to a class of observables called \emph{event shapes} (discussed later). By studying its fixed-order calculation, we can explicitly see the emergence of large logarithms. This, in turn, motivates the need for resummation, allowing us to understand how these logarithms are systematically treated. By examining this observable in detail, we also gain insight into the general features of resummation for other event shapes.

\subsection*{Thrust: leading-order calculation}
Thrust is defined as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:thrust}
	T\equiv\max_{\vec{n}}\frac{\sum_j|\vec{p}_j\cdot\vec{n}|}{\sum_j|\vec{p}_j|}\,,\quad \tau \equiv 1 - T \,,
\end{equation}
where $\vec{p}_j$ denotes the three-momentum of particle $j$ in the final state, and the unit vector $\vec{n}$ that maximises this quantity is referred to as the \emph{thrust axis}. For the process $e^+e^- \to \mathrm{hadrons}$, thrust provides a measure of how pencil-like an event is: events with $T \simeq 1$ correspond to two narrow back-to-back jets, while more spherically distributed events have smaller values of $T$. It is conventional to work with the variable $\tau$, such that the two-jet limit corresponds to $\tau \to 0$, as illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:thrust}. 
\begin{figure}[h]

\end{figure}

\noindent
We now calculate the differential distribution for thrust up to NLO. The Born contribution corresponds to the process $e^+e^- \rightarrow q\bar{q}$, giving
\begin{equation}
	\frac{1}{\sigma_0}\frac{d\sigma}{d\tau}=\delta(\tau)\,,
\end{equation}
where $\sigma_0$ is defined in Eq.~\ref{eq:sigma-LO}. 
At NLO, we consider the real emission process $e^+e^- \rightarrow q\bar{q}g$. The thrust for a three-particle final state is determined by the largest momentum fraction:
\begin{equation}
	T = \max[x_q, x_{\bar{q}}, x_g],
\end{equation}
where the minimum value is $T_\text{min} = 2/3$ for equal momenta and the maximum is $T_\text{max} = 1$. The corresponding contribution to the differential cross-section is
\begin{equation}
	\frac{1}{\sigma_0}\frac{d\sigma}{dT} = C_F \frac{\alpha_s}{2\pi} \int dx_q \int dx_{\bar{q}} \frac{x_q^2 + x_{\bar{q}}^2}{(1-x_q)(1-x_{\bar{q}})} \, \delta\big(T - \max[x_q, x_{\bar{q}}, x_g]\big),
\end{equation}
with the momentum fractions satisfying $x_q + x_{\bar{q}} + x_g = 2$.
After integrating over the allowed phase space, one finds
\begin{equation}
	\frac{1}{\sigma_0}\frac{d\sigma}{d\tau} = C_F \frac{\alpha_s}{2\pi} \left\{ \frac{3(1+\tau)(3\tau-1)}{\tau} + \frac{(4+6\tau(\tau-1))\ln\frac{1-2\tau}{\tau}}{\tau(\tau-1)} \right\}.
\end{equation}
We observe an infrared divergence as $\tau \to 0$, which is canceled by the divergence in the virtual (one-loop) contribution to $e^+e^- \rightarrow q\bar{q}$. The full NLO cross-section is finite, as expected for an IRC-safe observable (Sec.~\ref{sec:IRC}). Using the regulated and integrated NLO result from Eq.~\ref{eq:sigma-full}, the complete first-order distribution can be written as
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\label{eq:full-thrust-NLO}
	\frac{1}{\sigma_0}\frac{d\sigma}{d\tau} =\;& \delta(\tau) + C_F\frac{\alpha_s}{2\pi} \Bigg\{ \delta(\tau) \left( \frac{\pi^2}{3} - 1 \right) \\
	& + \Big[ 3(1+\tau)(3\tau-1) + \frac{(4+6\tau(\tau-1))\ln(1-2\tau)}{1-\tau} \left( \frac{1}{\tau} \right)_+ \Big] \\
	& - \frac{4+6\tau(\tau-1)}{1-\tau} \left( \frac{\ln \tau}{\tau} \right)_+ \Bigg\}.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Ignoring the $\delta$-function contributions, we refer to the terms that grow large as $\tau \to 0$ as \emph{logarithmically enhanced terms}:
\begin{equation}
	\left(\frac{1}{\sigma_0}\frac{d\sigma}{d\tau}\right)_{\text{log-enh}} = C_F \frac{\alpha_s}{2\pi} \left[ -3 \left(\frac{1}{\tau}\right)_+ - 4 \left(\frac{\ln \tau}{\tau}\right)_+ \right].
\end{equation}
The corresponding cumulative distribution (cumulant) reads
\begin{equation}
	\Sigma_{\text{log-enh}}(\tau) = \frac{1}{\sigma_0} \int_0^\tau d\tau' \frac{d\sigma}{d\tau'} = C_F \frac{\alpha_s}{2\pi} \left( 3L + 2L^2 \right),
\end{equation}
where $L \equiv \ln \frac{1}{\tau}$. The remaining terms in Eq.~\ref{eq:full-thrust-NLO} remain finite as $\tau \to 0$ and do not contribute to these logarithms.  

These logarithms arise from soft and collinear emissions, and their presence signals the breakdown of the fixed-order perturbative expansion in the small-$\tau$ region. At higher orders, the cumulant contains terms of the form 
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\Sigma(\tau)\supset\quad&\alpha_sL^2 \qquad \alpha_s L \qquad \alpha_s \\
&\alpha_s^2L^4 \qquad \alpha_s^2 L^3 \qquad \alpha_s^2 L^2 \qquad \alpha_s^2 L \qquad \alpha_s^2 \\
&\alpha_s^3 L^6 \qquad \alpha_s^3 L^5 \qquad \dots \\
&\,\,\vdots \\
&\alpha_s^n L^{2n}\qquad\dots \qquad \qquad \qquad  \qquad  \qquad  \qquad \qquad  \qquad \qquad \alpha_s^n
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Each power of $\alpha_s$ can generate up to two logarithms from soft and collinear divergences. These logarithmically enhanced terms pose two main issues: they spoil the convergence of the fixed-order perturbative expansion, and they indicate that the probability of observing a perfectly pencil-like event with $\tau = 0$ is effectively non-zero, reflecting the unphysical situation of free quarks.  \add{Plot of experimental vs. theory FO.}  \\ \\
To restore perturbation theory in this region, the perturbative expansion must be reorganised and \emph{resummed}. Resummation is the process of reordering the expansion: rather than expanding solely in powers of $\alpha_s$, one expands in powers of the logarithms $L$. The largest contributions are the \emph{leading-logarithm} (LL) terms, $\alpha_s^n L^{2n}$, followed by \emph{next-to-leading logarithm} (NLL) terms, $\alpha_s^n L^{2n-1}$, and so on.  
In the region where $\alpha_s L \sim 1$, the cumulant can be expressed in an exponentiated form:
\begin{equation}
	\Sigma(\tau) \simeq \exp \Big\{ L g_1(\alpha_s L) + g_2(\alpha_s L) + \alpha_s g_3(\alpha_s L) + \cdots \Big\},
	\label{eq:resummed-cummulant}
\end{equation}
where the exponent resums contributions to all orders in $\alpha_s$ at a given logarithmic accuracy. Here, $g_1$ resums all LL contributions of the form $\alpha_s^n L^{2n}$, $g_2$ includes NLL terms $\alpha_s^n L^{2n-1}$, and higher-order $g_i$ functions correspond to further subleading logarithmic accuracies.

\subsection*{Event-shapes}
The logarithms and the necessity for the resummed distribution is not unique to thrust. In fact these occur for any exclusive IRC safe observables. A particular set of these observables which are good at explaining the dynamics of QCD is a class of observables known as an event shape variable (event-shapes), where event-shapes are a class of IRC safe observables which measure the hadronic energy-flow in an event. Like many observables in QCD, an event-shape is an observable that provides us with precise measurements of the strong coupling. Furthermore, they are observables which measure the "shape" of the hadronic final state. Examples of event shapes are: 
\begin{itemize}
\item {One-jettiness}:
\begin{equation}
		\mathcal{T}_1\equiv  \sum_{i} \min\left[\frac{2q_a\cdot p_i}{Q_a}, \frac{2q_b\cdot p_i}{Q_b}, \frac{2q_c\cdot p_i}{Q_c}\right]\,,
	\end{equation}
and normalising by scale $Q$ to give a dimensionless $\tau_1\equiv\frac{\mathcal{T}_1}{Q}$. \add{Define other variables here.}
\item Transverse thrust
\begin{equation}
  T_t\equiv \frac{\sum_i |\vec q_{t,i}\cdot \vec q_T|}{ H_T q_T}\,.
\end{equation}
\add{We look at one minus the transverse thrust.} \add{Add in variables definition.}
\item Thrust minor
\begin{equation}
  T_m \equiv \frac{\sum_i |\vec q_{t,i}\times \vec q_T|}{H_T q_T}\,.
\end{equation}
\add{Add in variables definition.}
\end{itemize}

\section{Event shape resummation}
The CAESAR and ARES method (discussed in the following sections) looks at event-shape resummation.
\subsection*{Observable Requirements}
For both CAESAR and ARES, the observable we are considering needs to be both continuously global and rIRC safe. Let us discuss these properties:
\begin{description}
   \item[Continuously global] A global observable is one which is sensitive to all of the emissions in an event. An observable which is continuously global adds another feature such that the scaling of the observable with respect to the energy of the emission is the same everywhere in the phase space. If an observable is not continuously global, it results in the presence of additional large logarithms known as non-global logarithms (these will not be discussed in this report).
 \item[rIRC safety] In section \ref{sec:IRC}, we explained the concept of IRC safety. rIRC safety further constrains the observable, such that it is unaffected by additional soft and/or collinear emissions at widely separated scales. IRC safety involves two energy scales: the hard partons and the additional soft-collinear emissions. rIRC introduces a third (softer) energy scale, requiring that the observable remains insensitive to emissions in this new region of the phase space. This allows us to split the emissions into a set that are resolved and a set that are unresolved. 
 
\end{description}

\section{NNL Resummation: CAESAR}
\todo{NLL: Introduction of the cumulant for NLL}

\section{NNL Resummation: ARES}
\todo{NNLL: Formalism + ISR prescription }

\subsection*{Formulation}
The ARES method begins by understanding that any rIRC safe observable $V$, in the presence of a single soft emission collinear to leg $\ell$, can be parameterised in the following way \cite{Arpino:2019ozn}:
\begin{equation}
	V(\{p\},k)\simeq V_{\text{sc}}(k)\equiv d_\ell\left(\frac{k_t^{(\ell)}}{Q}\right)^ae^{-b_\ell\eta^{(\ell)}}g_\ell(\phi^{(\ell)})\,,
	\label{eq:general-sc-V}
\end{equation}
where $k_t^{(\ell)},\eta^{(\ell)},$ and $\phi^{(\ell)}$ are the transverse momentum, rapidity, and azimuthal angle of the emission $k$ with respect to the parent emitter $p_\ell$ and $a, b_{\ell}$ and $d_\ell$ are parameters. Note that $d_\ell$ is a coefficient which depends on the underlying Born kinematics, and we have introduced and arbitrary \enquote{resummation} scale $Q$ which we use as a reference normalisation scale for transverse momenta. 
 $a, b_{\ell}, d_\ell, g_\ell$ 
%Unsure if its best to put this here. 
\\ \\
Furthermore, we must consider an observable $V(\{\tilde{p}\},k_1,\cdots , k_n)$ which is a non-negative function of final-state $\{\tilde{p}\}$ and additional emissions $\{k_i\}$. Any continuously global, rIRC safe observable $V$ goes smoothly to zero for the born event such that:
\begin{equation}
V(\tilde{p}_1,\cdots , \tilde{p}_n)=V(p_1,\cdots ,p_n)=0\, .
	\label{eq:Born-observable}
\end{equation}
It is clear to see that the tilde denotes the final-state moment recoil due to the extra emissions and that there is a mapping between the recoiled and the Born momenta.
Additionally, in our case of the three-jet observable, we expect the observable to approach zero for momentum configurations that approach the limit of 3 narrow jets. 
We consider the cumulative distribution of a three-jet event shape $V(p_1,\cdots ,p_n)$, defined as the following:
\begin{equation}
	\Sigma_{\mathcal{H}}(v)\equiv\frac{1}{\sigma_{\mathcal{H}}}\sum_{n=3}^{\infty}\int d\Phi_n\frac{d\sigma_n}{d\Phi_n}\mathcal{H}(p_1,\cdots ,p_n)\,\Theta(v-V(p_1,\cdots ,p_n))\,,
	\label{eq:hard-cumulant}
\end{equation}
where $d\Phi_n$ is the $n$-particle phase space, $d\sigma_n/d\Phi_n$ is the normalised differential cross-section for producing $n$ final-state particles, and 
$\mathcal{H}(p_1,\cdots ,p_n)$ is an event selection function which is 1 for events with 3 or more hard jets and 0 otherwise. This can be calculated through jet algorithms but we will not be discussed in this report. \\ \\
In near-to-planar kinematics i.e. when $v\ll1$, we find that $\Sigma_{\mathcal{H}}(v)$ becomes the following:
 \begin{equation}
	\Sigma_{\mathcal{H}}(v)\simeq\frac{1}{\sigma_{\mathcal{H}}}\int d\Phi_3\frac{d\sigma_3}{d\Phi_3}\Sigma(\{p_1,p_2,p_3\},v)\,\mathcal{H}(p_1,p_2,p_3)\,.
	\label{eq:hard-cumulant-approx}
\end{equation}
In the region where $v\ll1$, large logarithms emerge in the function $\Sigma(\{\tilde{p}_1,\tilde{p}_2,\tilde{p}_3\},v)$. Our aim is to be able to resum these logarithms, up to a given logarithmic accuracy to all orders in the strong coupling (in our case NNLL). In fact, we find that this is equal to the following:
\begin{equation}
	\Sigma(\{p_1,p_2,p_3\},v)\equiv\mathcal{V}(\{p\})\sum_{n=0}^\infty S(n)\int\prod_{i=1}^n[dk_i]\,|\mathcal{M}(\{\tilde{p}\},k_1,\cdots ,k_n)|^2\,\Theta(v-V(\{\tilde{p}\},k_1,\cdots ,k_n)\, ,
	\label{eq:born-cumulant}
\end{equation}
where $S(n)$ is the symmetry factor e.g. $1/n!$ for $n$ identical gluons. Moreover, $\mathcal{V}(\{\tilde{p}\}$ includes all virtual corrections to the Born process, and $|\mathcal{M}(\{\tilde{p}\},k_1,\cdots ,k_n)|^2$ contains all real corrections.
Using properties of rIRC safety and derivations found in \cite{Banfi:2018mcq}, we find that the NNLL master formula, in the presence of initial soft radiation only, is the following:
\begin{multline}
  \label{eq:Sigma-NNLL-fs}
  \Sigma(\{p_1,p_2,p_3\},v)= e^{-R_{\mathrm{NNLL}}(v)}\left(\mathcal{F}_{\mathrm{NLL}}(\lambda)(1+\frac{\alpha_s(Q)}{2\pi}H^{(1)}
      +\frac{\alpha_s(Qv^{\frac{1}{a+b_3}})}{2\pi}C_{\mathrm{hc},3}^{(1)}) +\frac{\alpha_s(Q)}{\pi} \delta\mathcal{F}_{\mathrm{NNLL}}(\lambda)\right)
\end{multline}
where $\lambda\equiv \alpha_s(Q)\beta_0\ln(1/v)$ and
$\beta_0=(11 C_A\!-2 n_f)/(12\pi)$. 
In this formula, \(\mathcal{F}_{\mathrm{NLL}}\) and \(\delta\mathcal{F}_{\mathrm{NNLL}}\) have a general expression for any rIRC safe observable and are single logarithmic functions. This allows us to express them in terms of the single-logarithmic quantity \(\lambda\). We find that \(\mathcal{F}_{\mathrm NLL}\) is purely NLL, while the terms containing \(H^{(1)}, C_{\mathrm{hc},3}^{(1)}\), and \(\delta\mathcal{F}_{\mathrm NNLL}\) are of order NNLL. \\ \\
The idea is that at NLL, there are a collection of soft-collinear emissions. 
At NNLL, we still have this ensemble of soft-collinear emission contributing terms of $(\alpha_s^n L^n)$. However, in addition to this, there will be \emph{one} of the following: hard-collinear emission, soft wide-angle emission or, gluon splitting emission. Each one will contribute a factor of the coupling such that the terms are of order $\alpha_s^{n+1} L^n$, achieving NNLL accuracy.
We will now describe all the quantities within this master formula:
\begin{itemize}
\item the ``radiator'' $R_{\mathrm{NNLL}}(v)$ includes all virtual
  corrections of soft and/or collinear origin. These are divergent,
  but their divergences cancel with those corrections from real radiation. We will discuss this in a little more detail later in section \ref{sec:radiator}.
\item \emph{Resolved} soft and collinear emissions widely separated in
  angle, and the corresponding virtual corrections, build up to the
  NLL function $\mathcal{F}_{\mathrm{NLL}}(\lambda)$. To compute this
  function one must obtain the expression for the observable
  $V(\{\tilde p\},k_1,\dots,k_n)$ when $k_1,\dots, k_n$ are soft
  \emph{and} collinear. In particular, for rIRC safe observables, the
  following limit exists
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:V-lim}
    \lim_{v\to 0}\frac{V(\{\tilde p\},k_1,\dots,k_n)}{v} \equiv \frac{V^{\mathrm sc}(\{\tilde p\},k_1,\dots,k_n)}{v}\,.
  \end{equation}
  Given $V^{\mathrm{sc}}(\{\tilde p\},k_1,\dots,k_n)$, the function $\mathcal{F}_{\mathrm NLL}(\lambda)$ can be computed using the general formula
 \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:FNLL-formula}
    \mathcal{F}_{\mathrm{NLL}}(\lambda) = \int\! \dZ \,\Theta\left(1-\frac{\Vsc{\{k_i\}}}{v}\right)\,,
  \end{equation}
  where we have defined the soft-collinear measure $\dZ$ through the formula
  \begin{multline}
    \label{eq:dZ-def}
    \int\! \dZ \,G(\{k_i\}) \\ \equiv \lim_{\epsilon\to 0} \epsilon^{\RpNLL} \sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{1}{n!} \int \prod_{i=1}^n \left(\sum_{\ell_i} R'_{\text{NLL},\ell_i}\int_{\epsilon}^\infty \frac{d\zeta_i}{\zeta_i}\int_0^{2\pi}\frac{d\phi_i^{(\ell_i)}}{2\pi}\right)G(k_1,\dots,k_n)\,.
\end{multline}
In the above formula, we have introduced the rescaling variables
$\zeta_i\equiv V^{\mathrm{sc}}(\{\tilde p\},k_i)/v$. With
$\{\zeta_i,\phi_i^{(\ell_i)}\}$ fixed for event shapes, one can freely
integrate over emissions' rapidities, which yields a jacobian factor
$R'_{\text{NLL},\ell_i}$ for each emission and for each emitting leg.

\item $H^{(1)}$ and $C_{\mathrm{hc},3}^{(1)}$ are coefficients of order $\alpha_s(Q)$ due to the virtual corrections. Multiplying these by $\mathcal{F}_{\mathrm{NLL}}(\lambda)$, we obtain terms of order NNLL. 

\item All other \emph{resolved} soft or final-state hard-collinear emissions and the corresponding virtual corrections build the NNLL function
  $\delta\mathcal{F}_{\mathrm NNLL}(\lambda)$. More precisely, these
  consist of a single soft and/or collinear ``special'' emission,
  accompanied by an arbitrary number of soft and collinear emissions
  widely separated in angle (and the corresponding virtual
  corrections). The function $\delta\mathcal{F}_{\mathrm NNLL}(\lambda)$
  is the sum of various terms, and comes from relaxing different approximations that were used within the NLL calculation. %see what this means by the NLL calculation and reword this part.
  For a three-jet event shape we find this to be the following:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:dFNNLL}
    \delta\mathcal{F}_{\mathrm NNLL} = \delta\mathcal{F}_{\mathrm sc}+\delta\mathcal{F}_{\mathrm hc}+\delta\mathcal{F}_{\mathrm rec}+\Delta\mathcal{F}_{\mathrm rec}+\delta\mathcal{F}_{\mathrm wa}+\Delta\mathcal{F}_{\mathrm wa}+\delta\mathcal{F}_{\mathrm correl}\,,
\end{equation}
where each contribution reflects the region of phase space spanned by the special emission.%Work out what this special emission is. 

Note that the three-jet event introduces two new functions $\Delta\mathcal{F}_{\mathrm{wa}}$ and $\Delta\mathcal{F}_{\mathrm{rec}}$ which do not occur in the two-jet scenario. All these contributions within~\ref{eq:dFNNLL} can be expressed in terms of integrals over the soft-colliner measure $\dZ$ of the appropriate weight function $G(\{k_i\})$, as shown in equation~(\ref{eq:dZ-def}). 
\end{itemize}


\subsection*{The Radiator}
\label{sec: radiator}
At NNLL accuracy, with more than two emitting legs, it is convenient
to split the radiator $R_{\NNLL}(v)$ into the sum of a soft part $R_s(v)$ and a hard-collinear part $R_{\mathrm hc}(v)$:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:nnll-radiator}
  R_{\NNLL}(v) = R_s(v)+R_{\mathrm hc}(v)\,.
\end{equation}
The soft radiator $R_s$ includes contributions due to the unresolved soft and/or collinear radiation such that the radiator includes terms of order LL and above. The hard-collinear radiator, on the other hand, is due to the unresolved hard-collinear radiation and therefore contributes terms of NLL accuracy and above. In fact it is found in \cite{Arpino:2019ozn}, a master formula for  $R_{\mathrm NNLL}(v)$, whose explicit expression depends only on the observable properties with a single soft and collinear emission $a,b_\ell,d_\ell,g_\ell(\phi)$, which are found using equation~\ref{eq:general-sc-V}. The soft radiator is found to be:
\begin{equation}
R_s(v)=\sum_{(ij)}C_{(ij)}\sum_{\ell\in(ij)}\mathcal{R}_{\ell}^{(ij)}(v)\,,
\label{eq:soft-radiator}
\end{equation}
where $C_{(ij)}$ is the Casimir operator 
such that in our case, $C_{(q\bar{q})}=2C_F-C_A$ and $C_{(gq)}=C_{(g\bar{q})}=C_A$. The full expression for $\mathcal{R}_{\ell}^{(ij)}$ i.e. the soft radiator for each dipole is, is contained in \cite{Arpino:2019ozn}.
The hard-collinear radiator is found to be the following:
\begin{equation}
	R_{\mathrm{hc}}(v)=\sum_{\ell}R_{\mathrm{hc},\ell}(v)\,,
	\label{eq:radiator-hc}
\end{equation}
such that
\begin{equation}
	R_{\mathrm{hc},\ell}(v)=-h_2^{(\ell)}(\lambda)-\frac{\alpha_s}{\pi}h_3^{(\ell)}(\lambda)\,,
	\label{eq:radiator-hc-more}
\end{equation}
where the functions $h_2^{(\ell)}, h_3^{(\ell)}$ depend solely on $a$ and $b_{\ell}$ and are again contained within \cite{Arpino:2019ozn}.

\subsection*{$\delta\mathcal{F}_{\mathrm{NNLL}}$}
%Re-word this title
The corrections, $\delta\mathcal{F}_{\mathrm{sc}}, \delta\mathcal{F}_{\mathrm{wa}}, \Delta\mathcal{F}_{\mathrm{wa}}, \delta\mathcal{F}_{\mathrm{correl}}$ all have origin in resolved soft emissions, whereas the terms $\delta\mathcal{F}_{\mathrm{hc}}, \delta\mathcal{F}_{\mathrm{rec}}, \Delta\mathcal{F}_{\mathrm{rec}}$ have hard-collinear nature. 
% Each resolved real emission is found by requiring that $V(\{\tilde{p}\},k_i)>\epsilon v$ such that there is a lower bound on the phase-space where a resolved emission can take place and because of rIRC safety, $\epsilon$ is independent of $v$. 

\begin{enumerate}
\item[Soft emissions]: $\delta\mathcal{F}_{\mathrm sc}$ represents the running coupling corrections to the real emissions in the CMW scheme. It also accounts for the correct rapidity boundary for a single soft-collinear emission. $\delta\mathcal{F}_{\mathrm wa}$ arises from a soft emission near $\eta=0$ and accounts for the variation between the observable and its soft-collinear parametrisation for a single soft wide-angle emission accompanied by an ensemble of soft-collinear gluons. $\Delta\mathcal{F}_{\mathrm wa}$ is the NNLL contribution arising from wide angled resolved emissions. Finally, $\delta\mathcal{F}_{\mathrm correl}$ addresses the treatment of the splitting of a single soft and collinear gluon.
\item[Hard-collinear emissions]: $\delta\mathcal{F}_{\mathrm hc}$ originates from the emission of a hard-collinear parton at the level of the squared matrix element. $\delta\mathcal{F}_{\mathrm rec}$ is due to a hard-collinear emission (at the level of the kinematics) recoiling against the soft-collinear ensemble of emissions. This includes contributions due to spin correlations and hence may depend on the underlying Born momenta. $\Delta\mathcal{F}_{\mathrm rec}$ appears for the first time in near-to-planar three jet events. This accounts for correlations which occur between the spin of a hard collinear gluon and the event plane. 
\end{enumerate}
